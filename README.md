# QSAR_LightGBM
An applied computational intelligence project to determine whether LightGBM is a suitable replacement for the Random Forest, used in QSAR models.

The project was divided into three parts, because three different applications were tested. All scripts can be run directly in google colab environment, links to the codes and in the respective environment can be found right here.
